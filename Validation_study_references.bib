  abstract = {{Mitigating the effects of global change on biodiversity requires its understanding in the past. The main proxy of plant diversity, fossil pollen record, has a complex relationship to surrounding vegetation and unknown spatial scale. We explored both using modern pollen spectra in species-rich and species-poor regions in temperate Central Europe. We also considered the biasing effects of the trees by using sites in forests and open habitats in each region. Pollen samples were collected from moss polsters at 60 sites and plant species were recorded along two 1 km-transects at each site. We found a significant positive correlation between pollen and plant richness (alpha diversity) in both complete datasets and for both subsets from open habitats. Pollen richness in forest datasets is not significantly related to floristic data due to canopy interception of pollen rather than to pollen productivity. Variances (beta diversity) of the six pollen and floristic datasets are strongly correlated. The source area of pollen richness is determined by the number of species appearing with increasing distance, which aggregates information on diversity of individual patches within the landscape mosaic and on their compositional similarity. Our results validate pollen as a reconstruction tool for plant diversity in the past.}},

  volume = {98},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {{Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community structure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional groups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and within species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to influence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and their effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values without any consideration of variability in individual trait values. 2. In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant functional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to environmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two direct and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we quantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three functional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life histories. 3. Results showed a large variability of traits within species with large discrepancies between functional traits and species. This variability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between populations, the overall variability was partly explained by the selected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and radiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of traits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic. 4.Synthesis. Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific functional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we report new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given species can hide large functional variation for this species along environmental gradients. These findings suggest that intraspecific functional variability should be a concern for ecologists and its recognition opens new opportunities to better understand and predict ecological patterns in a changing environment. Further analyses are, however, required to compare inter- and intraspecific variability.}},

  volume = {228},
  abstract = {{Current interest and debate on pollen-assemblage richness as a proxy for past plant richness have prompted us to review recent developments in assessing whether modern pollen-assemblage richness reflects contemporary floristic richness. We present basic definitions and outline key terminology. We summarise four basic needs in assessing pollen--plant richness relationships --- modern pollen data, modern vegetation data, pollen--plant translation tables, and quantification of the co-variation between modern pollen and vegetation compositional data. We discuss three key estimates and one numerical tool --- richness estimation, evenness estimation, diversity estimation, and statistical modelling. We consider the inherent problems and biases in assessing pollen--plant richness relationships --- taxonomic precision, pollen-sample:pollen-population ratios, pollen-representation bias, and underlying concepts of evenness and diversity. We summarise alternative approaches to studying pollen--plant richness relationships. We show that almost all studies which have compared modern pollen richness with contemporary site-specific plant richness reveal good relationships between palynological richness and plant richness. We outline future challenges and research opportunities --- interpreting past pollen-richness patterns, estimating richness from macrofossils, studying pollen richness at different scales, partitioning diversity and estimating beta diversity, estimating false, hidden, and dark richness, and considering past functional and phylogenetic diversity from pollen data. We conclude with an assessment of the current state-of-knowledge about whether pollen richness reflects floristic richness and explore what is known and unknown in our understanding of pollen--plant richness relationships.}},

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {{Predicting the trajectory of ongoing diversity loss requires knowledge of historical development of community assemblages. Long-term data from palaeoecological investigations combined with key biodiversity measures in ecology such as taxonomic richness, functional diversity (FD), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and environmental factors expressed as Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs) could provide that knowledge. We explored the modern pollen--plant (moss polster pollen vs. surrounding vegetation) diversity relationships for herbaceous and woody taxa in calcareous fens from two different regions in Estonia, NE Europe. Associations of taxonomic richness, vegetation composition, FD (including functional alpha diversity and trait composition), PD and EIVs in modern pollen vs. plant data were studied with correlation analysis, Procrustes analysis and linear regression models. To test their potential use in palaeoreconstructions, diversity measures were applied on pollen data from Kanna spring fen reflecting fen vegetation development over the last nine millennia and diversity changes through time were studied using generalized additive models. Results showed significant pollen--plant richness correlations for herbaceous taxa at vegetation estimate scales up to 6 m radius and Procrustes analysis showed significant compositional associations at all plant estimate scales (up to 100 m). Woody taxa had no significant pollen--plant richness correlations but composition relationships were significant at plant estimate scales of 6--100 m. Traits that were best reflected by pollen data (both in terms of trait composition and functional alpha diversity) among woody and herbaceous taxa were seed number, clonality, SLA and LDMC. PD of herbaceous species was reflected by pollen data. Among the EIVs, Ellenberg L and T were significantly reflected by pollen data for both woody and herbaceous communities. Palaeoreconstruction from Kanna fen indicates that trends of woody taxa are mostly related to long-term changes in climate while diversity variables of herbaceous taxa closely follow autogenic processes within the fen. We suggest that pollen-based diversity estimates should be calculated separately for woody and herbaceous taxa as they clearly represent different spatial scales. Present study suggests that linking sedimentary pollen data with FD, PD and EIVs provides possibilities to examine long-term trends in community assembly and ecosystem processes that would be undetectable from traditional pollen diagrams.}},

However, if rates of climate‐driven immigration and/or exclusion of species are slow, then contemporary functional composition may be explained by paleoclimate as well as by contemporary climate. We tested this idea by coupling contemporary maps of plant functional trait composition across North and South America to paleoclimate means and temporal variation in temperature and precipitation from the Last Interglacial (120 ka) to the present. Paleoclimate predictors strongly improved prediction of contemporary functional composition compared to contemporary climate predictors, with a stronger influence of temperature in North America (especially during periods of ice melting) and of precipitation in South America (across all times). Thus, climate from tens of thousands of years ago influences contemporary functional composition via slow assemblage dynamics. Climate may determine functional composition if there is variation in the rates of immigration and exclusion linked to functional traits. We show strong Pleistocene legacies on the contemporary functional composition in the New World plant assemblages consistent with slow community assembly processes.}},

We address this concept by resolving: (a) can fossil pollen records be used to examine past variations in functional attributes; (b) can community‐level, functional responses to fire be obtained by coupling fire history with pollen derived plant traits; and (c) has directional selection promoted attributes that increase community flammability? Breitenbush Lake, Oregon, USA. We developed a framework based on ecological understanding of functional traits and pollen records to analyse variations in functional attribute expressions through time. Fire‐related functional attributes that indicate sensitivity to changes in fire activity were identified and associated with taxa from a pollen record. Nine of the 14 functional attributes were significantly related to fire frequency (number of fires 1,000 per year). When combined with fire history data, variation in the abundances of functional attributes suggest selection of plant community expressions that indicate community‐level responses to fire related to changes in structural development and changes in fire adaptation. Fire frequency variations may drive directional selection for fire‐adapted attributes, and against fire‐sensitive attributes. Our results indicate increased Holocene fire activity may have been linked to vegetation functional interactions with fire. Our method of combining paleoecological data with functional traits allowed reconstruction of community‐level changes in the expression of functional characteristics, providing evidence on structural development and changes in fire adaptation. Our results (a) highlight the capacity of paleoecological records to track plant community trait composition; (b) provide novel information on fire--vegetation relationships, independent of and complementary to conventional methods of disturbance‐based paleoecological interpretations; (c) suggest the Holocene fire trend may be linked to the type of biomass being burned through directional selection; and (d) suggest an application that may be applied to quantify community responses to various disturbances across broad temporal and spatial scales. It is commonly hypothesized that fire‐prone ecosystems develop as a result of fire selecting for flammable characteristics. Our method of linking functional‐ and paleo‐data reconstructs how fire selects for functional traits through time, that leads to changes community‐level structure and fire adaptation over \textbackslashtextasciitilde13,000 years.}},

  abstract = {{Paleoecological investigations using the pollen-plant functional trait linkage are increasing in value as new insights to past ecological function and dynamics are revealed. These retrospective approaches link pollen sequences to plant functional trait measurements to reveal long-term changes in ecosystem properties that are difficult to resolve using traditional paleoecological methods. Despite these methodological improvements and the newfound perspectives, there has yet to be thorough testing of whether transforming pollen to ecological function tracks functional trait distributions in geographic space. We assess this in North America by linking surface pollen samples to measurements of three functional traits that represent major axes of plant ecological strategy. Pollen-derived estimates of function were first used to investigate occupied trait space at different scales. These estimates were used to reconstruct the latitudinal functional diversity gradient of North America, and results were compared to the continent's functional diversity gradient estimated from tree assemblages and gradients based on pollen richness and evenness. Results indicated that the patterns in pollen-based function sufficiently track ecological function in trait and geographic space and the macroecological biodiversity pattern was reconstructed, although there were minor differences between the slopes of the functional diversity and each of the pollen index gradients. Taken together, the outcomes of our investigation indicate reliability in extending the pollen-plant functional trait linkage into deeper time, at least for examining North American functional dynamics.}},

  abstract = {{ 1. Quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation distribution and abundance from sedimentary pollen records provides an important baseline for understanding long term ecosystem dynamics and for the calibration of earth system process models such as regional-scale climate models, widely used to predict future environmental change. Most current approaches assume that the amount of pollen produced by each vegetation type, usually expressed as a relative pollen productivity term, is constant in space and time. 2. Estimates of relative pollen productivity can be extracted from extended R-value analysis (Parsons and Prentice, 1981) using comparisons between pollen assemblages deposited into sedimentary contexts, such as moss polsters, and measurements of the present day vegetation cover around the sampled location. Vegetation survey method has been shown to have a profound effect on estimates of model parameters (Bunting and Hjelle, 2010), therefore a standard method is an essential pre-requisite for testing some of the key assumptions of pollen-based reconstruction of past vegetation; such as the assumption that relative pollen productivity is effectively constant in space and time within a region or biome. 3. This paper systematically reviews the assumptions and methodology underlying current models of pollen dispersal and deposition, and thereby identifies the key characteristics of an effective vegetation survey method for estimating relative pollen productivity in a range of landscape contexts. 4. It then presents the methodology used in a current research project, developed during a practitioner workshop. The method selected is pragmatic, designed to be replicable by different research groups, usable in a wide range of habitats, and requiring minimum effort to collect adequate data for model calibration rather than representing some ideal or required approach. Using this common methodology will allow project members to collect multiple measurements of relative pollen productivity for major plant taxa from several northern European locations in order to test the assumption of uniformity of these values within the climatic range of the main taxa recorded in pollen records from the region.}},

  abstract = {{Methods of reconstructing changes in plant traits over long time scales are needed to understand the impact of changing environmental conditions on ecosystem processes and services. Although Holocene pollen have been extensively used to provide records of vegetation history, few studies have adopted a functional trait approach that is pertinent to changes in ecosystem processes. Here, for woody and herbaceous fen peatland communities, we use modern pollen and vegetation data combined with pollen records from Holocene deposits to reconstruct vegetation functional dynamics. The six traits chosen (measures of leaf area-to-mass ratio and leaf nutrient content) are known to modulate species' fitness and to vary with changes in ecosystem processes. We fitted linear mixed effects models between community weighted mean (CWM) trait values of the modern pollen and vegetation to determine whether traits assigned to pollen types could be used to reconstruct traits found in the vegetation from pollen assemblages. We used relative pollen productivity (RPP) correction factors in an attempt to improve this relationship. For traits showing the best fit between modern pollen and vegetation, we applied the model to dated Holocene pollen sequences from Fenland and Romney Marsh in eastern and southern England and reconstructed temporal changes in trait composition. RPP adjustment did not improve the linear relationship between modern pollen and vegetation. Leaf nutrient traits (leaf C and N) were generally more predictable from pollen data than mass-area traits. We show that inferences about biomass accumulation and decomposition rates can be made using Holocene trait reconstructions. While it is possible to reconstruct community-level trends for some leaf traits from pollen assemblages preserved in sedimentary archives in wetlands, we show the importance of testing methods in modern systems first and encourage further development of this approach to address issues concerning the pollen-plant abundance relationship and pollen source area.}},

  abstract = {{To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions ≤1 m2 and extents ≤10,000 ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated (>1 month interval) and ≤1 year in duration. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards. Analysing the spatial and temporal extents of 348 ecological studies published between 2004 and 2014, the authors show that although the average study interval and extent has increased, resolution and duration have remained largely unchanged.}},

  abstract = {{The relationships between modern pollen and floristic plant richness, diversity and evenness are assessed using pollen assemblages and associated vegetation data from 52 lakes along an elevational and vegetational gradient in the Setesdal valley of south-central Norway. Various data transformations were applied to minimise bias in the vegetation and pollen datasets. Plant species were transformed to their pollen or spore equivalents to reduce taxonomic biases. Pollen counts were transformed using Andersen's general pollen-representation values for northern European trees and shrubs and the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model with pollen-productivity estimates (PPEs) appropriate for Setesdal to minimise pollen-representation bias. Pollen count-size bias (before or after transformation) was eliminated by rarefaction analysis based on bootstrap resampling. Richness and diversity were quantified using Hill numbers (N0, N1, N2), and evenness was estimated as the ratios of N0, N1 and N2. Diversity partitioning was used to estimate $\beta$ diversity. The strongest correlations between pollen and plant richness and diversity are with pollen counts transformed using Andersen's representation values and rarefied to a common count size and with plants transformed to their pollen equivalents. However, if sites from the low-alpine zone are excluded where there are high values of far-transported tree pollen, the richness and diversity relationships are also statistically significant for untransformed pollen data and plants transformed into their pollen equivalents. The effects of data transformation on diversity partitioning and estimates of $\beta$ diversity are explored. We demonstrate that there are statistically significant positive relationships between pollen and plant richness and diversity along the entire elevational gradient after transforming the datasets to minimise biases due to taxonomic differences, differential pollen representation, and pollen-count size, and similar significant positive relationships along the forested parts of the gradient (nemoral, boreonemoral, southern boreal, middle boreal) after transforming the datasets to minimise biases due to taxonomic differences and pollen-count size.}},

  title = {{Pollen-Based Maps of Past Regional Vegetation Cover in Europe Over 12 Millennia---Evaluation and Potential}},
  volume = {10},
  abstract = {{Realistic and accurate reconstructions of past vegetation cover are necessary to study past environmental changes. This is important since the effects of human land-use changes (e.g. agriculture, deforestation and afforestation/reforestation) on biodiversity and climate are still under debate. Over the last decade, development, validation, and application of pollen-vegetation relationship models have made it possible to estimate plant abundance from fossil pollen data at both local and regional scales. In particular, the REVEALS model has been applied to produce datasets of past regional plant cover at 1{\textdegree} spatial resolution at large subcontinental scales (North America, Europe, and China). However, such reconstructions are spatially discontinuous due to the discrete and irregular geographical distribution of sites (lakes and peat bogs) from which fossil pollen records have been produced. Therefore, spatial statistical models have been developed to create continuous maps of past plant cover using the REVEALS-based land cover estimates. In this paper, we present the first continuous time series of spatially complete maps of past plant cover across Europe during the Holocene (25 time windows covering the period from 11.7 k BP to present). We use a spatial-statistical model for compositional data to interpolate REVEALS-based estimates of three major land-cover types (LCTs), i.e., evergreen trees, summer-green trees and open land (grasses, herbs and low shrubs); producing spatially complete maps of the past coverage of these three LCTs. The spatial model uses four auxiliary data sets---latitude, longitude, elevation, and independent scenarios of past anthropogenic land-cover change based on per-capita land-use estimates (``standard'' KK10 scenarios)---to improve model performance for areas with complex topography or few observations. We evaluate the resulting reconstructions for selected time windows using present day maps from the European Forest Institute, cross validate, and compare the results with earlier pollen-based spatially-continuous estimates for five selected time windows, i.e., 100 BP-present, 350--100 BP, 700--350 BP, 3.2--2.7 k BP, and 6.2--5.7 k BP. The evaluations suggest that the statistical model provides robust spatial reconstructions. From the maps we observe the broad change in the land-cover of Europe from dominance of naturally open land and persisting remnants of continental ice in the Early Holocene to a high fraction of forest cover in the Mid Holocene, and anthropogenic deforestation in the Late Holocene. The temporal and spatial continuity is relevant for land-use, land-cover, and climate research.}},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the scientific literature linking direct drivers of change and ecosystem services via functional traits of three taxonomic groups (vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates) to: (1) uncover trends and research biases in this field; and (2) synthesize existing empirical evidence. Our results show the existence of important biases in published studies related to ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, direct drivers of change, ecosystem services, geographical range, and the spatial scale of analysis. We found multiple evidence of links between drivers and services mediated by functional traits, particularly between land-use changes and regulating services in vegetation and invertebrates. Seventy-five functional traits were recorded in our sample. However, few of these functional traits were repeatedly found to be associated with both the species responses to direct drivers of change (response traits) and the species effects on the provision of ecosystem services (effect traits). Our results highlight the existence of potential ``key functional traits,'' understood as those that have the capacity to influence the provision of multiple ecosystem services, while responding to specific drivers of change, across a variety of systems and organisms. Identifying ``key functional traits'' would help to develop robust indicator systems to monitor changes in biodiversity and their effects on ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services supply.}},

  abstract = {{Models of atmospheric dispersal of anemophilous pollen are important tools in Quaternary plant ecology for determining pollen-source areas and for applying distance-weightings to vegetation data in formal pollen-vegetation calibrations. The most widely applied model is Prentice's model, which uses a modified form of Sutton's equation for atmospheric diffusion to predict pollen-source areas from size of the depositional basin and a set of depositional parameters (deposition velocity of the pollen grains and mean wind speed) and atmospheric parameters (turbulence parameter, vertical diffusion coefficient). We review the physical theory underlying Sutton's equation and Prentice's model, explore the effects of different values of the depositional and atmospheric parameters on model predictions, and provide prescriptions for model application, parameter specification, and further research on pollen dispersal. Most applications of the models to pollen dispersal have assumed neutral atmospheric conditions. We argue that most pollen dispersal takes place in unstable atmospheric conditions, and prescribe appropriate values for the atmospheric parameters for unstable conditions. Our simulations using these parameters indicate more widespread pollen dispersal from a source than under neutral conditions. We review available data sets for sedimentation velocity of pollen grains, and compare the measured estimates with sedimentation velocities predicted from Stokes's Law to assess validity of the data. Substantial variability exists among data sets, but several are suitable for application to pollen-dispersal models. Finally, we discuss aspects of release, dispersal, and deposition of anemophilous pollen that are in need of further theoretical and empirical study. Such studies will contribute not only to Quaternary plant ecology but also to understanding of pollination biology, population genetics, and functional morphology of pollen grains and pollen-bearing organs.}},

  volume = {8},

  abstract = {{The condition of forest ecosystems depends on the temporal and spatial pattern of management interventions and natural disturbances. Remnants of previous conditions persisting after disturbances, or ecosystem legacies, collectively comprise ecosystem memory. Ecosystem memory in turn contributes to resilience and possibilities of ecosystem reorganization following further disturbance. Understanding the role of disturbance and legacies is a prerequisite for maintaining resilience in the face of global change. Several legacy concepts discussed in the peer-reviewed literature, including disturbance, biological, soil, land-use, and silvicultural legacies, overlap in complex ways. Here, we review these established legacy concepts and propose that the new terms ``material legacy'' (individuals or matter, e.g., survivors, coarse woody debris, nutrients left after disturbance) and ``information legacy'' (adaptations to historical disturbance regimes) cut across these previous concepts and lead to a new classification of legacies. This includes six categories: material legacies with above- and belowground, and biotic and abiotic categories, and information legacies with above- and belowground categories. These six legacies are influenced by differential patterns of editing and conditioning by ``legacy syndromes'' that result from natural or human-manipulated disturbance regimes that can be arranged along a gradient of naturalness. This scheme is applied to a case study of hemiboreal forests in the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, where natural disturbance, traditional clearcut silviculture, and afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands constitute the three main legacy syndromes. These legacy syndromes in turn influence forest response to management actions and constrain resilience, leading to a mosaic of natural, manipulated, and artificial (novel) ecosystems across the landscape, depending on how the legacies in each syndrome affect ecological memory.}},

  abstract = {{A key goal of functional ecology is identifying relationships between species traits and environmental conditions. Here, the nature and significance of these relationships to community composition on long ecological timescales is investigated using paleoecological and paleoenvironmental data from coastal British Columbia, Canada. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, two three-table statistical techniques, are used to link traits of the region's dominant woody plants to environmental conditions over the last 15 000 calendar years (cal yr) through a fossil pollen record derived from lake sediments. Both RLQ and fourth-corner analyses revealed highly significant correlations between plant traits and temporal changes in environmental conditions. Axis 1 of the RLQ explained 92\{\%} of the total covariance between plant species traits and paleoenvironmental variables and was correlated most strongly with temperature and relative growth rate. In general, climate change during the cold period following deglaciation favored species such as Alnus sinuata and Pinus contorta that exhibit a ``fast'' life-history strategy (e.g., high relative growth rate, short life span, low shade tolerance), whereas the relative climatic stability of the last 8000 cal yr favored species such as Tsuga heterophylla that exhibit a ``slow'' life-history strategy (e.g., low relative growth rate, long life span, high shade tolerance). Fourth-corner analyses revealed significant correlations between all paleoenvironmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, summer insolation, vegetation density) and most plant traits (relative growth rate, minimum seed-bearing age, seed mass, height, life span, and shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances). The strongest correlation was between paleotemperature and height, reflecting the positive effect of temperature on plant growth and development and the overarching competitive advantage that height confers. This research demonstrates that environmental conditions interact significantly with life-history and stress tolerance traits over long ecological timescales to determine forest composition. Climate is the ultimate control on postglacial forest composition and species abundances, but long-term community assembly is also constrained through interspecific differences in plant traits.}},

  title = {{How People Domesticated Amazonian Forests}},
  volume = {5},
  abstract = {{For millennia, Amazonian peoples have managed forest resources, modifying the natural environment in subtle and persistent ways. Legacies of past human occupation are striking near archaeological sites, yet we still lack a clear picture of how human management practices resulted in the domestication of Amazonian forests. The general view is that domesticated forests are recognizable by the presence of forest patches dominated by one or a few useful species favored by long-term human activities. Here, we used three complementary approaches to understand the long-term domestication of Amazonian forests. First, we compiled information from the literature about how indigenous and traditional Amazonian peoples manage forest resources to promote useful plant species that are mainly used as food resources. Then, we developed an interdisciplinary conceptual model of how interactions between these management practices across space and time may form domesticated forests. Finally, we collected field data from 30 contemporary villages located on and near archaeological sites, along four major Amazonian rivers, to compare with the management practices synthesized in our conceptual model. We identified eight distinct categories of management practices that contribute to form forest patches of useful plants: (1) removal of non-useful plants, (2) protection of useful plants, (3) attraction of non-human animal dispersers, (4) transportation of useful plants, (5) selection of phenotypes, (6) fire management, (7) planting of useful plants, and (8) soil improvement. Our conceptual model, when ethnographically projected into the past, reveals how the interaction of these multiple management practices interferes with natural ecological processes, resulting in the domestication of Amazonian forest patches dominated by useful species. Our model suggests that management practices became more frequent as human population increased during the Holocene. In the field, we found that useful perennial plants occur in multi-species patches around archaeological sites, and that the dominant species are still managed by local people, suggesting long-term persistence of ancient cultural practices. The management practices we identified have transformed plant species abundance and floristic composition through the creation of diverse forest patches rich in edible perennial plants that enhanced food production and food security in Amazonia.}},

  abstract = {{The relationship between palynological diversity and floristic diversity was studied on the basis of sediment surface sample pollen data from nine small lakes and vegetation data within a 250m radius from the lake shore of each. The nine study areas are situated in the patchy cultural landscape of Southern Estonia and were chosen to represent landscape changes along a gradient from closed forest to open vegetation. Two diversity measures -- richness and evenness -- were used to compare the palynological and floristic data.A total of 307 plant species were recorded in the vegetation representing 127 pollen types. Only 52 pollen types were recorded in the sediment surface samples of which 43 had parent plants in the vegetation. Significantly lower floristic richness was found in closed surroundings than in more open surroundings. Study sites with open vegetation also had significantly higher palynological richness (number of pollen types recorded in surface sediments). The additional pollen types recorded in surface sediments from open vegetation were widespread types mostly of insect-pollinated taxa such as Ranunculus, Rubiaceae, Melampyrum, Filipendula, Potentilla or Vaccinium. The parent plants of these pollen types were frequent in the landscape. This suggests that the main mechanism governing palynological richness in this study was not floristic diversity but rather variance in pollen productivity. Since woodland has a higher pollen production than open areas (grassland and fields) per unit land surface, open areas tend to show a better representation of slightly rarer but widespread herb pollen types. No relationship was found between palynological and floristic diversity of wind-pollinated taxa and tree taxa partly because the pollen source area for these pollen types is much larger than 250m.}},

  abstract = {{Quaternary pollen records may contribute uniquely to the understanding of present plant diversity. Pollen assemblages can reflect diversity at community and landscape scales but the time resolution of most studies does not match that of modern ecological studies. Because of the complicating effects of differential pollen productivity and dispersal, pollen records do not directly reflect equitability aspects of vegetation diversity. Vegetation diversity indices other than S (the total number of taxa) are therefore not appropriate for pollen assemblages. As a measure of the species richness palynological richness is biased by the lack of taxonomic precision, by a possible interference on pollen dispersal from vegetation structure and by pollen representation. The nonlinear relationship between species richness and pollen‐taxa richness may be used in attempts to estimate past floristic richness from fossil pollen assemblages. Using a hypothetical example the strong effect of cover shifts in the vegetation affecting taxa with different representation (Rrel) values on observed palynological richness is demonstrated. It is suggested that estimates of relative pollen productivity should be used to guide the pollen sum on which pollen‐type richness is estimated by rarefaction techniques and this approach is illustrated using a paired site study of late Holocene diversity dynamics. The need for a modern training set relating pollen‐type richness to species richness, pollen productivity and vegetation structure is emphasized.}},

We found that all traits were conserved within lineages, but nevertheless communities assembled from many lineages showed a smaller variation in trait-states of most traits (including dispersal traits) than communities assembled from few lineages. Hence, within lineages, species are not randomly assembled into communities, contradicting Neutral Theory. In fact, we find evidence for evolutionary divergence in trait-states as well as present-day mutual exclusion among related, similar species, suggesting that functional diversity of communities increased due to past and present interactions between species within lineages.}},

We used a data set of 1062 pollen samples from 20 sites covering the last 14 500 yrs to estimate plant richness, evenness, functional and phylogenetic diversity (community-weighted mean and mean pair-wise distance). We adjusted existing functional and phylogenetic diversity measures for the pollen data and tested the methods with a simulation study. The simulations showed that species-based and pollen-based diversity estimates were all significantly positively correlated. The Late Glacial (14 500--11 650 cal. yr BP) and the mid-Holocene (8000--4000 cal. yr BP) periods showed contrasting values for most of the diversity components, and several diversity estimates were strongly associated with climate. The cold climate during the Late Glacial led to high phylogenetic diversity, and relatively low functional diversity. Climate warming during the transition from the Late Glacial to the Holocene was followed by a decrease in phylogenetic diversity but an increase in functional diversity based on plant height and seed weight. Increasing human impact in the late Holocene was associated with an increase in plant richness and decreases in functional diversity based on plant height and seed weight and in phylogenetic diversity of herbs. Pollen-based functional and phylogenetic diversity provide novel insights into post-glacial vegetation change and its drivers. Both functional and phylogenetic diversity were closely related to climatic conditions, suggesting that trait differences play an important role in long-term community response to climate change. Our results indicate that human impact during the last two millennia has influenced functional and phylogenetic diversity negatively by suppressing plants with certain traits (functional convergence) and giving advantage to plants from certain phylogenetic lineages. We see great potential in the further development of functional and phylogenetic diversity methods for pollen data.}},

  title = {{Patterns of modern pollen and plant richness across northern Europe}},
  abstract = {{Sedimentary pollen offers excellent opportunities to reconstruct vegetation changes over past millennia. Number of different pollen taxa or pollen richness is used to characterise past plant richness. To improve the interpretation of sedimentary pollen richness, it is essential to understand the relationship between pollen and plant richness in contemporary landscapes. This study presents a regional‐scale comparison of pollen and plant richness from northern Europe and evaluates the importance of environmental variables on pollen and plant richness. We use a pollen dataset of 511 lake‐surface pollen samples ranging through temperate, boreal and tundra biomes. To characterise plant diversity, we use a dataset formulated from the two largest plant atlases available in Europe. We compare pollen and plant richness estimates in different groups of taxa (wind‐pollinated vs. non‐wind‐pollinated, trees and shrubs vs. herbs and grasses) and test their relationships with climate and landscape variables. Pollen richness is significantly positively correlated with plant richness (r = 0.53). The pollen plant richness correlation improves (r = 0.63) when high pollen producers are downweighted prior to estimating richness minimising the influence of pollen production on the pollen richness estimate. This suggests that methods accommodating pollen‐production differences in richness estimates deserve further attention and should become more widely used in Quaternary pollen diversity studies. The highest correlations are found between pollen and plant richness of trees and shrubs (r = 0.83) and of wind‐pollinated taxa (r = 0.75) suggesting that these are the best measures of broad‐scale plant richness over several thousands of square kilometres. Mean annual temperature is the strongest predictor of both pollen and plant richness. Landscape openness is positively associated with pollen richness but not with plant richness. Pollen richness values from extremely open and/or cold areas where pollen production is low should be interpreted with caution because low local pollen production increases the proportion of extra‐regional pollen. Synthesis. Our results confirm that pollen data can provide insights into past plant richness changes in northern Europe, and with careful consideration of pollen‐production differences and spatial scale represented, pollen data make it possible to investigate vegetation diversity trends over long time‐scales and under changing climatic and habitat conditions.

We evaluate how climate and human disturbances affect community trait composition. We found weak relationships between environmental conditions and traits at the taxon level, but strong effects for community‐mean traits. Overall, community‐mean traits were more responsive to human disturbances than to climate change; human‐induced erosion increased the dominance of dense‐wooded, non‐zoochorous species with compound leaves, and human‐induced fire increased the dominance of tall, zoochorous taxa with large seeds and simple leaves. This information can help to enhance our understanding of forest responses to past environmental changes, and improve predictions of future changes in tropical forest composition.}},

  abstract = {{Functional traits of organisms are key to understanding and predicting biodiversity and ecological change, which motivates continuous collection of traits and their integration into global databases. Such trait matrices are inherently sparse, severely limiting their usefulness for further analyses. On the other hand, traits are characterized by the phylogenetic trait signal, trait--trait correlations and environmental constraints, all of which provide information that could be used to statistically fill gaps. We propose the application of probabilistic models which, for the first time, utilize all three characteristics to fill gaps in trait databases and predict trait values at larger spatial scales. For this purpose we introduce BHPMF, a hierarchical Bayesian extension of probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). PMF is a machine learning technique which exploits the correlation structure of sparse matrices to impute missing entries. BHPMF additionally utilizes the taxonomic hierarchy for trait prediction and provides uncertainty estimates for each imputation. In combination with multiple regression against environmental information, BHPMF allows for extrapolation from point measurements to larger spatial scales. We demonstrate the applicability of BHPMF in ecological contexts, using different plant functional trait datasets, also comparing results to taking the species mean and PMF. Sensitivity analyses validate the robustness and accuracy of BHPMF: our method captures the correlation structure of the trait matrix as well as the phylogenetic trait signal -- also for extremely sparse trait matrices -- and provides a robust measure of confidence in prediction accuracy for each missing entry. The combination of BHPMF with environmental constraints provides a promising concept to extrapolate traits beyond sampled regions, accounting for intraspecific trait variability. We conclude that BHPMF and its derivatives have a high potential to support future trait-based research in macroecology and functional biogeography.}},

  title = {{Pollen‐based reconstruction reveals the impact of the onset of agriculture on plant functional trait composition}},
  abstract = {{The onset of agriculture improved the capacity of ecosystems to produce food, but inadvertently altered other vital ecosystem functions. Plant traits play a central role in determining ecosystem properties, therefore we investigated how the onset of agriculture in Europe changed plant trait composition using 78 pollen records. Using a novel Bayesian approach for reconstructing plant trait composition from pollen records, we provide a robust method that can account for trait variability within pollen types. We estimate an overall four‐fold decrease in plant size through agriculture and associated decreases in leaf and seed size. We show an increase in niche space towards the resource‐acquisitive end of the leaf economic spectrum. Decreases in leaf phosphorus might have been caused by nutrient depletion through grazing and burning. Our results show that agriculture, from its start, has likely been gradually impacting biogeochemical cycles through altered vegetation composition. The onset of agriculture improved the capacity of ecosystems to produce food, but inadvertently altered other ecosystem functions. We evaluate how agriculture and climate affect plant functional composition and reveal selection of common traits across agricultural landscapes.}},
